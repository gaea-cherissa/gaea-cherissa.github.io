/* To build out the content of the site, look in the javascript (right after the css in the file) and the first thing you will see is a giant "object" called site. You can sort of imagine how it works. { "key" : "value" } in javascript means an object, which is a list of key-value pairs. [ {...}, {...}, ... ] means an array of objects. So for example the global "nav" is an object which contains "paintings", "illustration", et c. Meanwhile "paintings" is an object with its own nav, which is your submenu of earthscapes, dystopic present, et c. See wikipedia for JSON for more info on the syntax here. Some of those pages have a "gallery", which is an array of objects, each one has a "fn" (filename, but without the .jpg or _thumb.jpg), title, year, medium, size, and "desc". desc is a big blob of whatever HTML you want to use to describe it. You can see that teshekpuk has all these attributes defined but iliamna only has some, so only part of the description shows up for iliamna when you click on it. The rest have nothing defined so nothing shows up in the description area. You can fill in more descriptions and filenames to put content into the site. */

The far-reaching lore of this region’s unique magic captures hearts and minds far and wide. Yet, an ongoing debate over that which lies beneath its caribou birthing grounds has ensued for decades, and is now at a crucial pinnacle.</p></br><p>This region is important habitat for 180 migratory bird species, polar bears in search of sea ice, the Porcupine caribou herd, and it is traditional land of the Gwich’in and Inupiaq people. </p></br>In 2017, the Trump administration passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that included amendments to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act by Lisa Murkowski that mandated at least two lease sales in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge for oil drilling. An Environmental Impact Statement was completed in 2019. Currently, a Record of Decision is in progress for the official lease auction.</p></br><p>NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act requires development projects on federal land– such as drilling for oil in the Refuge, the Keystone XL Pipeline, and the Dakota Access Pipeline – to undergo environmental impact assessment. NEPA also requires consideration of the disproportionate impacts to minority and low-income communities which have too often been the frontlines of environmental degradation.</p></br><p>This year, the Trump administration finalized revisions to NEPA that loosen its requirements, limits the length and time allotted for impact assessments, eliminates requirement to consider cumulative impacts and climate change, and reduces public accessibility. </p></br><p>Allowing extraction industries to get their feet in the door in this way facilitates future efforts to continue ripping up that which we hold vital and sacred without limitation. </p></br><p>This painting was one of three paintings commissioned by the <a hre=\"https://northern.org/\">Northern Alaska Environmental Center</a> and will be up for auction to support their work in November.</p><br><p>More information about how to take action for the refuge here:</p?<br><p><a href=\"https://www.defendthesacredalaska.org/arctic-refuge/\">https://www.defendthesacredalaska.org/arctic-refuge/</a></p><br><p><a href=\"https://northern.org/news/arctic-refuge-action-whats-next/\">https://northern.org/news/arctic-refuge-action-whats-next/</p>" },

The warm, fresh, river water and sediment swirl into the Beaufort Sea and stir and break up the sea ice.

Today, what few, sparse pockets of extant old-growth forest remain tucked in the crevices of the urbanization, suburban sprawl, and agriculture. In contrast, the forests of the northwestern regions of North America still stand tall, despite continued logging and other activities, including the practice of “clear-cutting” of old-growth forests, whose ancient, intricate ecosystems do not regenerate on a timescale that we will observe. The Canadian boreal forest represents 25 percent of the world’s remaining intact forest, considered “the lungs of the world” along with the Amazon rainforest; however, Canada is also a world leader in rate of forest loss. This painting depicts a patchwork of clearcut forested area northwest of Prince George, British Columbia.

var es = '<div class=\"series\"><div class=\"series"\"><p>When the Apollo 8 space mission landed, the astronauts photographed the Earth gazing back on them, foreign in its familiar reminiscence of the moon itself they then stood upon, waxing and shining. The people of Earth for the first time could visualize the Earth as a small planet within an infinitely scaling expanse. One small, unlikely blue marble, circling a star in the dark.</p><br><p>Forty years into the future, with colonial Space Age and Internet Age technologies, we casually glimpse the Earth’s surface on a daily basis. Where once these scenes revolutionized our collective conscious, we now experience them with the indifference of quotidian utility. Yet despite how commonplace this imagery has become, the subject matter remains awe-strikingly profound.</p><br><p>Our lived lives have expanded spatially and condensed temporally as we travel in automobiles, airplanes, and trains, converse through telephones, and exchange ever-increasing amounts of information through the internet. We now travel great distances with ease and speed, and organisms of all kinds get caught in the wake of our global expanse. No longer are humans confined to specific regions. One can travel from Pennsylvania to Alaska in the span of a day with no notion of the distance covered, no experience or knowledge of all the small intricateness that exists across the lands between destinations.</p><br><p>These days, one can follow dramas unfolding in your city’s streets or thousands of miles away, gazing distantly through screens, empathizing with people and places unseen and unknown. We are more connected and disconnected than ever before.</p><br><p>These days, one can gaze down upon our own destruction in real time, like dispossessed gods of ourselves. We can view through a lens in space our blue-green home, in all its grandness in full color, with all of its intricacies and layers shining in the sunlight, like delicate layers of paint.</p><br><p>As a painter, I meddle in an ancient human craft, obstinately remaining in practice despite today’s pace and precision. I manifest these imperfect images with the slowness of human hands, reinterpreting what computer eyes have seen with my own. In this way, I connect with these faraway places. I present to you scenes from this celestial, surveilling perspective free of the scars inflicted by maps and their makers.</p><br><p>This show of paintings is a tribute to these sentiments, as well a tribute to the lands themselves, the stories, histories, inquiries, and emotions we have set upon them, the names we have given them and meaning we ascribe to them, the changes they are seeing and the threats they are facing – damages done and not yet done. </p><br><p>I invite viewers to reflect on the places from which they originate, places you seek and have sought,  places you care deeply for though you have not been there, places that hold for you magic, wonderment, memory, identity, spirit. What has been gained and learned, and what has been lost and forgotten from this novel perspective of our world and worlds, large and small.</p><br></div><p class=\"cvp\"><button class=\"cv\"><a href=\"EarthscapesProgram.pdf" download>>>  \"September 12, 2020 Earthscapes Program PDF\" << </a></button></p></div>'

var bio = '<div class=\"bio\" id=\"bio\"><img src=\'\'><div class=\"biotext\"<p>Gaea Cherissa Dukelow is an artist/ecologist currently based in Fairbanks, Alaska. She is a granddaughter of midwestern agriculture, but raised at the edge of a gradient of eastern suburban sprawl and deciduous forest. After drifting into the charmingly gritty, beautiful complexity of Philadelphia for several years, she gathered up a satchel of pent-up wanderlust and exported herself to the vast, last frontier, the Golden Heart City, Fairbanks, Alaska. There, she collects ecological data by occuption, and occupies a studio at Well Street Art Company. </p><br><p>Having studied art at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, MD and forest ecology at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, New York, she manifests a view of the world that mixes intuition and myth-making with critical analysis and reflection. Inspired both by the infinite beauty of the natural world and the mourning of its destruction, she grapples with the cognitive dissonance left behind in the wake of this strange, modern world, memorializing this sensation with the vividness of traditional painting media. </p><br></div><p class=\"cvp\"><button class=\"cv\"><a href=\"GCherissaDukelow--CV.pdf" download>>>  CV << </a></button></p>';
