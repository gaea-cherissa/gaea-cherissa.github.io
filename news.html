  <p><h4><u>February 5, 2021 : Fairbanks Arts Association "Gift Shop Artist of the Month" && Well Street Art Co.'s "The Pink Show"</u></h4>

   <br>
   <p>This month, the Fairbanks Arts Association is featuring me as their "Gift Shop Artist of the Month." We set up a sort of mini exhibit in their gift shop with two original pieces, reproduction prints, postcards, and stickers. Olena Ellis and John Hagen have their beautiful work exhibited in the gallery.

   <p>Meanwhile, Ethan Lauesen curated their first open-call exhibition at Well Street Art Co., "The Pink Show," for which I created a couple of small post-wildfire regeneration scenes with blazes of fireweed.</p>

   <br>
   <p>The Fairbanks Art Association’s member invitational show this past month was good time – a delightful turnout of community members!</p>
   <br>
   <p>This painting I contributed to the show depicts an aerial view of Healy and the Usibelli Coal Mine – the only operational coal mine in Alaska. The area is a open-pit surface mine operation. Surface mining involves accessing coal (or other minerals) by clearing forests and using heavy earth-moving equipment and explosives to excavate the earth to access coal seams that are up to a few hundred feet below the surface.</p>
   <br>
   <p>Coal mined from Usibelli fuels 6 coal-fired power plants which provide about 40% of the electricity in Interior Alaska.</p>
   <br>
   <p>Included in these 6 coal-fired power plants is the Fort Wainwright 65-year old central heat and power plant (CHPP), which is at risk of malfunction or failure and presently under evaluation to remain in use, be replaced by a new coal-fired CHPP, be replaced by a natural gas-fueled system, or potentially other proposed alternatives that meet their criteria.</p>
   <br>
   <p>A Draft Environmental Impact Statement regarding this decision is open for a second round of public comments until February 22, 2021.</p>

   <p>The three paintings I created for the Northern Alaska Environmental Center, "Refuge," "Teshekpuk," and "District" are featured in a virtual juried art exhibit as part of the Wild and Scenic Film Festival. The festival is organized annually, usually taking place in Nevada City and Grass Valley, CA, but due to the pandemic, for 2020 the festival is virtual.  The Northern Alaska Environmental Center's recent documentary film "Love is the Way," about the stories of activists and other Alaskans in the fight to protect the Arctic Refuge. The online festival is January 14-24.

   <br>
   <p>The Northern Alaska Environmental Center Featured Artist of 2020 show with the Lemonade Stand was a great and lovely success! It was a beautiful fall evening with good spirits. The show remains intact in the Lemonade Stand adjacent to Tamara's house for folks who were not able to make the Saturday show. To come see the show, send me an email at the address at the bottom of this webpage, or through the 'contact' section. The show will remain until the end of September, like leaves falling from trees.</p>
